Dear audience,

Welcome to this AI project repository! The focus of this project is Jarvis, a basic AI that utilizes deep learning techniques with the PyTorch library.

Update 0:

To activate Jarvis, simply clap and the program will begin speaking. In addition to recognizing claps, Jarvis utilizes a database containing personal information such as family and friends' names. It is important to note that if you are running the program for the first time, the AI will say the name provided in the database, which can be modified to your desired name.

The key feature of this project is the database, as providing more data can increase the accuracy of the AI. However, due to the limitations of the chatsonic API, the database can only contain 4000 characters. You can modify the database to fit your needs if you decide to test out this project.

Furthermore, if you would like to save the chat log, simply uncomment the write function in the AIBrain class.

Update 1:

I recently added an exciting new feature to our Python codebase. The code is now able to play songs, which greatly enhances the user experience. Additionally, I was able to fix a bug where the code would deploy Web WhatsApp on its first run, but now, when the user tries to send a message, it correctly deploys Web WhatsApp. 

To add an extra touch of personality, I also incorporated the iconic "Jarvis starting music" from YouTube into our codebase, giving it a fun and unique touch. These changes will undoubtedly make our code more efficient, user-friendly, and enjoyable to use.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and we hope you find this project informative and enjoyable to experiment with!
